# Tuff

Another port of a very old game of mine, this time for the original black and white Gameboy!

In case you're trying to get started with your own DMG game, you might find a lot of the code very helpful, the core runtime is mostly separated from the game code and there are many useful routines and a whole lot of comments for you to check out.

## How to compile

Get https://github.com/bentley/rgbds/ and then run `make`.

You'll find the assembled ROM under `build/main.gb`, it should play in a GameBoy Emulator of your choice.
