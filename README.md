# Tuff

Another port of a very old game of mine, this time for the original black and white gameboy.

In case you're trying to get started with your own game, you might find some parts 
of the code very helpful (e.g. Mainloop, Vblank Code, DMA).


## How to compile

Get https://github.com/bentley/rgbds/ and then run `make`.

You'll find the assembled ROM under `build/main.gb`, it should play in a GameBoy Emulator of your Choice.
